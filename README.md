# Project Overview

Gallery of Horns is our first project utilizing REACT and the follwoing is a description of our assignment for various lab exercises of the CodeFellows 301 Course.

Lab 01: I generated all the files using create-react-app in my terminal and then imported them into GitHub. After creating a branch to do my work on, I added a header, main and footer to my App component. Inside of the main component, I added two HornedBeast components that each pass a title, image URL, and description.

Lab 02: I added a data.json file which contained a list of 20 horned beasts in the form of an array filled with individual objects. This allowed me to use the .map method to individually display each horned beast, along with thier respective image, titles and descriptions. Then I utilized React-Bootstrap to put each horned beast on it's own card, and on each card there is a button. The button allows a user to click on the button, and then using state I displayed the number of clicks on each individual button.

Lab 03: Working with state using props. The user wants to be able to view the details of an image, then when they click on the image, the image will render larger on the screen with the description displayed.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
